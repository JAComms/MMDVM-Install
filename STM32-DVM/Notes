I will upload pre-built binaries ready for upload at http://dvswitch.org/files/HAM/MMDVM/

Building firmware from source
=============================
Login as root or use sudo -s
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -Y

cd /srv
git clone https://github.com/N4IRS/MMDVM-Install.git
cd /srv/MMDVM-Install/STM32-DVM
chmod +x *.sh
./required-libs.sh
./get-src.sh

You now have the needed utilities and source code for the firmware.

cd /usr/src/MMDVM
YOU MUST do the next step
Replace the Config.h and the SerialRB.h from this repository
Did you do the previous step?
Do a test to make sure everything builds correctly
make -f Makefile.CMSIS
No errors?

The firmware is in the /usr/src/MMDVM/bin directory


Upload firmware to STM32-DVM USB
================================
Disconnect STM32-DVM from the host USB
Insert JP1 jumper
Connect STM32-DVM to the host
PWR, ACT and DMR MUST be lit solid, NOT flashing.

ls
Do you see mmdvm.hex?
stm32flash -w bin/mmdvm.hex -v /dev/ttyUSB0

Disconnect STM32-DVM from host USB
remove JP1 jumper
Connect STM32-DVM to host USB
start MMDVMHost

=================================================

Upload firmware to the STM32-DVM PiHat  
Shutdown the Raspberry Pi
Disconnect power to Raspberry Pi
Insert JP1 jumper
Power ON the Raspberry Pi
PWR, ACT and DMR MUST be lit solid, NOT flashing.

ls
Do you see mmdvm.hex?
stm32flash -w bin/mmdvm.hex -v /dev/ttyAMA0

Shutdown the Raspberry Pi
Disconnect power to Raspberry Pi
remove JP1 jumper
Power ON the Raspberry Pi
start MMDVMHost
