LTE Cell Scanner / Tracker
--------------------------

This is a fork of https://github.com/Evrytania/LTE-Cell-Scanner with modifications
To build under Raspbian (ARM) My primary purpose is to use this to calibrate an
RTL-SDR. For this all that is needed is CellSearch. 

This is a collection of tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using
very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832
based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8
bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 ppm.

The 'CellSearch' program can be used to search for LTE carriers within a range
of frequencies.  Once an LTE frequency has been located, 'LTE-Tracker' can be
used to monitor and track, in realtime, any LTE cells on that frequency.

The main documentation in html format can be found on the web at:
  http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools
And in the doc/index.html subdirectory of this distribution.

------
  cd LTE-Cell-Scanner
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make CellSearch

------

Quick usage instructions:
------

Search for LTE carriers within a common LTE frequency range used in the US:
  CellSearch --freq-start 715e6 --freq-end 768e6

Results will look something like this:
$ ./CellSearch --freq-start 778e6 --freq-end 778e6

The CrystalCorrectionFactor values can be converted to PPM correction figures
(for use in correcting other applications) using: PPM = 1e6 * (1 - CrystalCorrectionFactor)
(calculated using python):

$ python
>>> 1e6*(1-1.0000020858851397243)
